# CC-professional-statement

Growing up in a digitial world where vunerabilities lurk, I understood the importance of strong security online. I consider myself someone who is ready to face any task, ready to face and challenge up front. My excitment to learn more and develop solutions to issues drives my committment to organizations and the protection of their users. My focus in Cybersecurity is helping to protect those who might not see the risks, and mitigating the damage done through future prevention and establishing strong security.
